# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
The input should have the following format:  The first line must specify the type of scheduling that should be simulated. The options are: FCFS (first-come-first-serve; a.k.a. FIFO - first-in-first-out) SJF (shortest job first) SRTF (shortest-remaining-time-first), and RR &lt;quantum> (round-robin; note that the specification for round-robin also requires a time quantum on its first line). Each following line provides process information of a single process: process identifier, process arrival time, and process burst time. Sample Input RR 3 P1 0 15 P2 2 6 P3 5 2 The sample input specifies that Round Robin should be used with a time quantum of 3 time units. There will be three processes:  P1 with the arrival time 0 and the CPU burst of 15 time units, P2 with the arrival time 2 and the CPU burst of 6 time units, and P3 with the arrival time 5 and the CPU burst of 2 time units.
